h1. Grammatical Evolution Exploratory Ruby Toolkit (GERET)

Copyright (c) 2009 Pavel Suchmann, please see the LICENSE file.

GERET is the toolkit & library designed for exploring the potential of the Grammatical Evolution.

Grammatical Evolution is the approach to the genetic programming which can be used to automatically generate programs or solutions in any language.

Please see the inventors' pages:
* http://www.grammatical-evolution.org/ 
* http://grammaticalevolution.org/

or read the general introduction:
* http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_evolution 

or purchase the book written by GE creators: 
* http://www.springer.com/computer/artificial/book/978-1-4020-7444-8 

h1. Other implementations of GE

* http://bds.ul.ie/libGE/ : C++
* http://ncra.ucd.ie/Site/GEVA.html  : Java
* http://rubyforge.org/projects/drp/ : Ruby

h1. Features

* multiple objectives optimisation
* human-readable yaml-based configuration
* ABNF conformance http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_Backus%E2%80%93Naur_Form 
* various GE mappers (bucket rule, positional independence, several node expansion strategies, wrapping...)
* various genetic operators (ripple & LHS crossover, nodal/structural mutations)
* various search algorithms (easily extensible by new ones)
* simple & efficient interface to the domain-specific task

h1. Requirements

The library itself is written in pure Ruby (version 1.8 works but 1.9 is substantially faster), no gem dependencies needed.
However, samples require various software (tcc compiler, Java VM, GHDL simulator). 

Please read a particular sample/*/README before running the sample.

h1. Installation

There are no special installation steps at this moment. Please clone the git repo and play around. 
(To be changed in the future.)

cd GERET
test/ts_all.rb # check library
test/integration.rb # check tools & sample runs -- SLOW

h1. Play Now

Run "tools/evolve.rb sample/<task>/<algorithm>.yaml" for evolution. 
Interrupt the run by ^C. Repeated evolve.rb invocation loads <algorithm>.store and continues evolving.
rm <algorithm>.store if you want to start population(s) from the scratch.
Tune <algorithm_config>.yaml files to see some experiments failing. :-)

For example:
tools/evolve.rb sample/santa_fe_ant_trail/generational.yaml

h1. More Advanced Games

Try various tools/*
For instance:
tools/sensible_init.rb sample/santa_fe_ant_trail/generational.yaml > genotype.txt # generate the genotype
cat genotype.txt # see the genotype
tools/gpmap.rb sample/santa_fe_ant_trail/generational.yaml < genotype.txt # see the phenotype

See algorithm/* for various search algorithms.

Look at lib/* for reusable classes.

Generate the class documentation:
cd lib/
rdoc
<your-favourite-browser> doc/index.html &

Hack your own grammar.abnf files.
Try to write your own pipe.rb tasks (or pipe.py, pipe.java, /usr/local/bin/pipe... ) 
...
Give me know. ;-)
